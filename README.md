# Colonial Williamsburg Travel Guide 🏛️🌳

## Project Overview
Tourists visiting Colonial Williamsburg often face **information overload** when trying to plan a trip. Attractions, weather, and dining options are scattered across multiple websites, making it difficult to get a clear picture of what to do and when.  

This dashboard solves that by creating a **centralized travel guide** that brings together:
- **Attractions** → curated experiences with images, links, and ratings  
- **Restaurants** → searchable by cuisine, with contact info and websites  
- **Weather** → live forecasts to help visitors plan their day  

###  Audience
- Tourists and families visiting Colonial Williamsburg  
- Students interested in data visualization and web dashboards  
- Local businesses who want to see how tourism data can be centralized  

### Value
- One-stop dashboard for Williamsburg trip planning  
- Real-time, data-driven recommendations  
- User-friendly design with interactive cards, dropdowns, and charts
