# Colonial Williamsburg Travel Guide 🏛️🌳

## Project Overview
Tourists and new college students, like our group, are visiting Colonial Williamsburg and often do not know where to start. Attractions and dining options, along with the weather variable, are scattered across multiple websites, making it difficult to get a clear picture of what to do and when.  

This dashboard solves that by creating a **centralized travel guide** that brings together:
- **Attractions** → curated experiences with images, links, and ratings  
- **Restaurants** → searchable by cuisine, with contact info and websites  
- **Weather** → live forecasts to help visitors plan their day  

###  Audience
- Tourists and families visiting Colonial Williamsburg  
- Students interested in data visualization and web dashboards  
- Local businesses who want to see how tourism data can be centralized  

### Value
- One-stop dashboard for Williamsburg trip planning  
- Real-time, data-driven recommendations  
- User-friendly design with interactive cards, dropdowns, and charts
